CellScape is a visualization tool for integrating single cell phylogeny with genomic content to clearly display evolutionary progression and tumour heterogeneity. 

To run CellScape, type the following commands in R:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools") # if not already installed  
library(devtools)  
install_bitbucket("MO_BCCRC/cellscape")  
library(cellscape)  
example(cellscape) # to run examples
```

One of these, for example, is copy number data of a triple negative breast cancer patient published in Wang et al. (2014).
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(devtools)  
install_bitbucket("MO_BCCRC/cellscape")  
library(cellscape) 
# EXAMPLE 2 - COPY NUMBER DATA
# single cell tree edges
tree_edges <- read.csv(system.file("extdata", "cnv_tree_edges.csv", package = "cellscape"))
# cnv segments data
cnv_data <- read.csv(system.file("extdata", "cnv_data.csv", package = "cellscape"))
# annotations
sc_annot <- read.csv(system.file("extdata", "cnv_annots.tsv", package = "cellscape"), sep="\t")
# custom clone colours
clone_colours <- data.frame( clone_id = c("1","2","3"), colour = c("7fc97f", "beaed4", "fdc086"))
# run cellscape
cellscape(cnv_data=cnv_data, tree_edges=tree_edges, sc_annot=sc_annot, width=800, height=475, show_warnings=FALSE, clone_colours=clone_colours)
```

To view the documentation for CellScape, type the following command in R:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?cellscape
```

CellScape was developed at the Shah Lab for Computational Cancer Biology at the BC Cancer Research Centre.
