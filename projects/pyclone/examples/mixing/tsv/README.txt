In this folder there are four files generated by mixing healthy tissue from four individuals. Each experiment was done
in varying proportions as described in "Detection of low prevalence somatic mutations in solid tumors with ultra-deep 
targeted sequencing". These four samples correspond to experiments Cal-A - Cal-D from that paper run on MiSEQ.

To generate YAML files for PyClone analysis use 

'PyClone build_mutations_file {TSV} {YAML} --reference_prior {REF_PRIOR} --variant_prior {VAR_PRIOR}'. 

Where TSV is one of the .tsv files below, YAML is the .yaml file which will be created, REF_PRIOR is a method of 
assigning priors for the reference population and VAR_PRIOR is a method for assigning priors for the variant population.


Example outputs from this command are in the ../yaml folder.
